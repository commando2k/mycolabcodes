#Phys290 Colab  
My codes from colab that i used for "Intro to Computer Usage in Physics" class
1. [Homework 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rDm6AtOSwP82FWWfQ-2kREu9pP9fFgDH)  
We utilized matplotlib library to visualize mathematical functions.  
2. [Homework 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nIFxTa7Sh6xskIW8rQooueMAzKLYJB_L)  
We solved some physics problem using numpy and matplotlib.  
3. [Homework 3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CxLMeXLAxiV15zOlF_SQaJOXxWrsf23u#scrollTo=xXfpUfek_VVP)  
We revived what we have learned from python and solved varius physics questions and visualized many physical phenomena  
4. [Final](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QMcvfn5acvYeB0bMRc3ZWnWj-wwp6c_n)  
In our final we learned curl of a function, how to visualize integral equations and how to solve them, we made a simple X O X game and also visualized various given data.
